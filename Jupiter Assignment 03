## Introduction   
Provide a description of your initial project idea and include images of the concept sketches that you created in Part 1 of this assignment.  Explain the reasoning behind your final choice of the project concept, whether it’s based on one of the initial sketches, or a departure from the original idea.  

My final project is a game controller specialized for shmup games. Because I want to chellange a more playable and technical project, so I chose to use the Unity Serial port.
The controller connects to my Unity game and includs 4 input values (3 in joystick & 1 in button) and 1 LED output as feedback while score. 
There are 3 plan for controller and 3 plan for feedback interaction. For the controller, plan A is traditional and allow precise manual, plan B and C is more portable but hard to controll.
For the interaction, plan 3 is simple and could proveide constant positive feedbacks, plan 1 is hard to represent by single LED, plan 2 interact too less.

## Implementation   
Explain your process of prototype development including all applicable aspects such as hardware (electronics), firmware (MicroPython code), software (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or other code), integrations (Adafruit IO, IFTTT, etc.), enclosure and mechanical design.  
In general, think of your audience as someone new trying to learn how to make your project and make sure to cover anything helpful to explain how it functions.  Use a separate subheader for each part:

### Hardware
List all the separate hardware components used in your project and briefly explain what they do.  To create a list with markdown syntax, use `-`, `*`, or `+` characters with each line of text:  
* PC: Where Unity games locate, run the unity game and recive inputs from the controller, giving back feedback datas from game to output devices.
* atoms3lite: Run ESP32 microphython, connect inputs, PC and outputs.
* joystick2: Response for 3 inputs, move the joystick to controll player move in XY axis, press joystick to trigger special attack.
* button: Only responsible for 1 input, only has T&F two states to controll the main attack behavior.
* I2C port: extension of atoms3, provide more ports to connect with other units.
* i2c wires: connect hardware units with atoms3 in a simple way.
* type C port: connect atoms3 to PC thonny.

Include at least one image showing your hardware wiring in detail.  This could be several close-ups photos with the goal of showing the wiring connections are made between the ATOM board and each hardware component.  

### Firmware   

Provide a link to your MicroPython code and explain the important parts that make your prototype work.  Most likely you should explain the inputs/outputs used in your code and how they affect the behavior of the prototype.

To include code snippets, you can use the code block markdown, like this:

``` Python  
if(sensor_val > 100):  # sensor value higher than threshold
   led_pin.on()  # turn on LED
```

### Software   

If applicable, explain the important software components of your project with relevant code snippets and links.  

### Integrations   

Include a link to and/or screenshots of any communication components used in your project, like Adafruit IO feeds, dashboards, IFTTT applets, etc.  

### Enclosure / Mechanical Design   

Explain how you made the enclosure or any other physical or mechanical aspects of your project with photos, screenshots of relevant files such as laser-cut patterns, 3D models, etc. (it’s great if you’re willing to share the editable source files too!)

## Project outcome  

Summarize the results of your final project implementation and include some photos of the prototype and a video walkthrough showing it working.  

Note that GitHub has a small size limit for uploading files via browswer (25Mb max), so you may choose to use a link to YouTube, Google Drive, or another external site.

## Conclusion  

As you wrap up the project, reflect on your experience of creating it.  Use this as an opportunity to mention any discoveries or challenges you came across along the way.  If there is anything you would have done differently, or have a chance to continue the project development given more time or resources, it’s a good way to conclude this section.

## Project references  

Please include links to any online resources like videos or tutorials that you may have found helpful in your process of implementing the prototype. If you used any substantial code from an online resource, make sure to credit the author(s) or sources.
