## Assignment #2

### Introduction

The second project is a game HOTAS based on motion sensor and physical button. It connects to a mini-game made by P5. 
Player will control the black block to gather red points while evading from other grey blocks. 
Player get a boost and trun orange while pressing the HOTAS button.
Game over when hit by grey blocks, the game will count highest score and return to menu.

### State Diagram

Explain the interactive behaviors of the prototype you created and include a 
state diagram (flowchart) to represent it.  For example, below is an example 
state diagram included in the assignment description:

### Hardware

* M5(extended) x1
* button x1
* motion sensor x1
* MAC(connect to p5)

### Firmware   

import os, sys, io
import M5
from M5 import *
from hardware import *
from unit import IMUProUnit
import time

i2c0 = None
imupro_0 = None
IMU_data = None
inputX = 0
inputY = 0
inputA = 0

def inputdetection():
    global inputX, inputY, inputA
    Xvalue = IMU_data[0]
    Yvalue = IMU_data[1]
    #print(Xvalue,",",Yvalue)
    if abs(Xvalue) > 0.3:
        if Xvalue > 0:
            inputX = -1
        else:
            inputX = 1
    else:
        inputX = 0

    if abs(Yvalue) > 0.3:
        if Yvalue > 0:
            inputY = -1
        else: 
            inputY = 1
    else:
        inputY = 0
        
    if pin1.value():
        inputA = 0
    else:
        inputA = 1
    
M5.begin()
i2c0 = I2C(0, scl=Pin(39), sda=Pin(38), freq=100000)
imupro_0 = IMUProUnit(i2c0)
pin1 = Pin(1, mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)

while True:
    M5.update()
    IMU_data = imupro_0.get_accelerometer()
    #print(IMU_data)
    inputdetection()
    print(inputX,",",inputY,",",inputA) #output
    time.sleep_ms(50)
 
### Physical Components   

* laser-cut acrylic board x2 (controller body)

### Project outcome  

The project relized a restartable game controlled by controller's angle and button. 
The play test was successful, but it seems too hard for most people. 
Hopefull next time there will be better graphics and sounds to create immersive experiences.
