## Assignment #1


### Introduction

In the first project, I made a wireless phone charger that could indicate phone charge status.
The design is to prevent neglected disconnection. Inspired by in-car wireless charger.

### State Diagram

While no phone is on charger, LED off
While phone is charging, LED on
While phone charge complete(after 5s), LED blink.

### Hardware

* Atom3 x1 (chip, 1output/1input)
* Wires x10 (for circuit build)
* BreadBoard x1 (for wire connection/place resistor)
* LED x1 (for)

### Firmware   

import os, sys, io
import M5
from M5 import *
from hardware import *
import time
pin7 = None
pin8 = None
ChargingTime = None
state = None
def setup():
global pin7, pin8, ChargingTime, state
M5.begin()
pin7 = Pin(7, mode=Pin.OUT)
pin8 Pin(8, mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)
ChargingTime = 0
state = False
def loop():
global pin7, pin8, ChargingTime, state 
M5.update()
if pin8.value():
pin7.off()
ChargingTime = 0
state = False
else:
if ChargingTime >= 5:
if state:
pin7.off()
state = False
else:
pin7.on()
state = True
else:
pin7.on()
ChargingTime = ChargingTime + 0.5
time.sleep(0.5)

To include code snippets, you can use the code block markdown:

``` Python  
  if input_pin.value():  # read digital input
    led_pin.off()        # turn off LED light
  else:
    led_pin.on()         # turn on LED light
```

### Physical Components   

CompositeWires
Contain 2 copper foil strip warped by paper, using double taps to fix parts on two ends.
They are more safe ,stable, reusable, free to connect and disconnet, easy to produce.
I made a lot in term 4's physical computing, so I use the old wires directly, they works well even after 2 terms.

The button
Trigger by putting phone on it, which is a variation of composite wires.
It use the elasticity from fodded paper to keep good copper foil connection and disconnect.

ChargerBase
Made by cardboard found in hillside workshop. Fixed by hot glue gun. 
This material is light and strong in triangular structure, you can cut them by scissor.
It was made on Wednsday, easy-carry and strength are important consideration.

### Project outcome

The final prototype works well with different types of phones. 
If you take away phone while charging, the charger timer will also reset.
