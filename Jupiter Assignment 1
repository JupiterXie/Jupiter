## Assignment #1


### Introduction

Provide a description of your initial project idea and include images of 
the concept sketches that you created in Part 1 of this assignment.  

### State Diagram

While no phone is on charger, LED off
While phone is charging, LED on
While phone charge complete(after 5s), LED blink.

### Hardware

* Atom3 x1 (chip, 1output/1input)
* Wires x10 (for circuit build)
* BreadBoard x1 (for wire connection/place resistor)
* LED x1 (for)

### Firmware   

import os, sys, io
import M5
from M5 import *
from hardware import *
import time
pin7 = None
pin8 = None
ChargingTime = None
state = None
def setup():
global pin7, pin8, ChargingTime, state
M5.begin()
pin7 = Pin(7, mode=Pin.OUT)
pin8 Pin(8, mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)
ChargingTime = 0
state = False
def loop():
global pin7, pin8, ChargingTime, state 
M5.update()
if pin8.value():
pin7.off()
ChargingTime = 0
state = False
else:
if ChargingTime >= 5:
if state:
pin7.off()
state = False
else:
pin7.on()
state = True
else:
pin7.on()
ChargingTime = ChargingTime + 0.5
time.sleep(0.5)

To include code snippets, you can use the code block markdown:

``` Python  
  if input_pin.value():  # read digital input
    led_pin.off()        # turn off LED light
  else:
    led_pin.on()         # turn on LED light
```

### Physical Components   

Explain what products, materials or components you used for the project. 
If you fabricated your own project components, include some details on 
how you made them.

### Project outcome  

Summarize the results of your project implementation and include at least 
1 photo of the finished prototype.  

Finally, include a short video walkthrough of your project showing all of 
its functioning aspects (voice over is optional but could be helpful).  

Note that GitHub has a small size limit for uploading files via browswer (25Mb max), 
so you may choose to use a link to YouTube, Google Drive, or another external site.
